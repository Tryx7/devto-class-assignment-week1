**Course:** Data Engineering: Real-Time Data Processing with Kafka
**Date:** September 21, 2025


## Introduction to Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka has fundamentally transformed how modern applications handle real-time data streaming. Originally developed by LinkedIn in 2011 and later open-sourced as an Apache project, Kafka has evolved into the **de facto standard** for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. This distributed event streaming platform demonstrates remarkable scalability, capable of handling trillions of events daily, making it indispensable for companies operating at internet scale.

Kafka's architecture follows a sophisticated **publish-subscribe model** where producers write data to topics, and consumers read from these topics in a decoupled manner. The system is specifically engineered to be fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable, and highly available, making it suitable for mission-critical applications across various industries including finance, e-commerce, transportation, and social media.

According to the Apache Kafka documentation, "Kafka is used for building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications" (Apache Kafka Documentation, 2023). This capability has made it the backbone of modern data-driven organizations.

## Core Kafka Architecture and Components

### The Essential Trio: Zookeeper, Brokers, and Clients

Kafka's robust architecture rests on three fundamental components that work in harmony to deliver reliable messaging:

**Zookeeper** serves as Kafka's coordination service, managing cluster metadata, broker leadership election, and topic configuration. As the official Kafka documentation emphasizes, "Zookeeper is used for maintaining and coordinating the Kafka brokers." It acts as the central nervous system that keeps the distributed system synchronized, tracking which brokers are alive, and maintaining topic metadata. While newer versions of Kafka are moving toward removing the Zookeeper dependency, it remains essential in most production deployments.

**Kafka Brokers** form the core messaging engine, responsible for receiving, storing, and serving messages. A Kafka cluster typically consists of multiple brokers for fault tolerance and scalability. Each broker handles a subset of partitions across various topics, ensuring that the load is distributed evenly across the cluster. Brokers are stateless, meaning they don't track consumer information, which contributes to Kafka's scalability.

**Producers and Consumers** represent the client applications that interact with Kafka. Producers publish messages to topics, while consumers subscribe to topics and process the messages. This decoupled architecture allows for flexible system design where producers and consumers can be scaled independently.

### Topic Partitioning and Replication

Kafka achieves its remarkable scalability through **topic partitioning**. Each topic is divided into partitions, which can be distributed across multiple brokers. This allows for parallel processing and horizontal scaling. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages that is continually appended to. Partitions are the unit of parallelism in Kafka - multiple consumers can read from different partitions simultaneously, enabling high-throughput processing.

**Replication** ensures fault tolerance by maintaining copies of partitions across different brokers. Kafka uses a leader-follower model where the leader handles all read/write requests for a partition, while followers passively replicate the data. If a leader fails, one of the followers automatically becomes the new leader, ensuring continuous availability.

## Complete Kafka Setup: From Installation to Production

### Step 1: Installing and Starting Zookeeper

Zookeeper must be running before starting Kafka brokers. Here's the comprehensive setup process:

```bash
# Download and extract Kafka (includes Zookeeper)
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/3.4.0/kafka_2.13-3.4.0.tgz
tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.4.0.tgz
cd kafka_2.13-3.4.0

# Start Zookeeper (default port 2181)
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

The Zookeeper configuration file (`zookeeper.properties`) defines essential parameters:

```properties
# zookeeper.properties
dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper
clientPort=2181
maxClientCnxns=0
admin.enableServer=false
tickTime=2000
initLimit=10
syncLimit=5
```

### Step 2: Configuring and Starting Kafka Broker

Once Zookeeper is running, start the Kafka broker with appropriate configuration:

```bash
# Start Kafka broker (default port 9092)
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

The server configuration file (`server.properties`) specifies critical parameters:

```properties
# server.properties
broker.id=0
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
num.partitions=1
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
default.replication.factor=1
offsets.topic.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.min.isr=1
```

### Step 3: Topic Management and Validation

Create topics to organize your messages and verify the setup:

```bash
# Create a topic named 'weatherstream'
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic weatherstream \
--bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--partitions 3 --replication-factor 1

# Create a topic for user data
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic user-events \
--bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--partitions 5 --replication-factor 1

# List existing topics
bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# Describe topic details
bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic weatherstream \
--bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

## Practical Implementation: Real-time Weather Data Streaming

### Enhanced Weather Producer Implementation

This producer demonstrates best practices for real-time data ingestion, including error handling, batching, and efficient resource management:

```python
# weather-producer.py
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
import time
import requests
from datetime import datetime
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger("weather-producer")

class WeatherDataProducer:
    def __init__(self, bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092'):
        self.producer = KafkaProducer(
            bootstrap_servers=bootstrap_servers,
            value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'),
            acks='all',           # Wait for all replicas to acknowledge
            retries=3,            # Retry on failure
            batch_size=16384,     # Batch size in bytes
            linger_ms=10,         # Wait up to 10ms for batching
            compression_type='gzip'  # Compress messages
        )
        self.topic = "weatherstream"
        self.cities = ['Nairobi', 'Eldoret', 'Nakuru', 'Mombasa', 'Kisumu']
        self.api_key = '0384de6d728525bffb441c520c59a46f'
    
    def fetch_weather_data(self, city):
        """Fetch current weather data for a specific city with error handling"""
        try:
            url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={self.api_key}&units=metric"
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                data = response.json()
                return {
                    "city": city,
                    "temperature": data["main"]["temp"],
                    "humidity": data["main"]["humidity"],
                    "pressure": data["main"]["pressure"],
                    "condition": data["weather"][0]["main"],
                    "wind_speed": data["wind"]["speed"],
                    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                    "source": "OpenWeatherMap"
                }
            else:
                logger.warning(f"API error for {city}: {response.status_code}")
                return None
                
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            logger.error(f"Timeout fetching data for {city}")
            return None
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error fetching data for {city}: {e}")
            return None
    
    def stream_weather_data(self):
        """Continuously stream weather data for all cities"""
        logger.info("Starting weather data streaming...")
        
        while True:
            successful_messages = 0
            for city in self.cities:
                try:
                    weather_data = self.fetch_weather_data(city)
                    if weather_data:
                        # Send message with city as key for consistent partitioning
                        future = self.producer.send(
                            topic=self.topic,
                            key=city.encode('utf-8'),
                            value=weather_data
                        )
                        
                        # Optional: Handle delivery reports
                        try:
                            future.get(timeout=10)
                            successful_messages += 1
                            logger.info(f"Sent weather data for {city}: {weather_data['temperature']}Â°C")
                        except Exception as e:
                            logger.error(f"Message delivery failed for {city}: {e}")
                    
                    time.sleep(2)  # Brief pause between API calls
                    
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.error(f"Error processing {city}: {e}")
            
            logger.info(f"Completed round: {successful_messages}/{len(self.cities)} messages sent")
            time.sleep(30)  # Wait 30 seconds before next round

if __name__ == "__main__":
    producer = WeatherDataProducer()
    try:
        producer.stream_weather_data()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logger.info("Producer stopped by user")
    finally:
        producer.producer.close()
```

### Advanced Weather Consumer Implementation

The consumer demonstrates sophisticated message processing, including alerting, error handling, and consumer group management:

```python
# weather-consumer.py
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json
from datetime import datetime
import logging
import sys

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger("weather-consumer")

class WeatherDataConsumer:
    def __init__(self, bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092'):
        self.consumer = KafkaConsumer(
            'weatherstream',
            bootstrap_servers=bootstrap_servers,
            auto_offset_reset='latest',
            enable_auto_commit=True,
            auto_commit_interval_ms=5000,
            value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8')),
            group_id='weather-dashboard-group',
            session_timeout_ms=10000,
            heartbeat_interval_ms=3000
        )
        
        # Temperature thresholds for alerts
        self.high_temp_threshold = 35
        self.low_temp_threshold = 10
        self.message_count = 0
        
        logger.info("Weather consumer initialized successfully")
    
    def process_message(self, message):
        """Process individual weather message with comprehensive logging"""
        try:
            data = message.value
            city = data['city']
            temperature = data['temperature']
            
            self.message_count += 1
            
            # Generate alerts for extreme temperatures
            if temperature > self.high_temp_threshold:
                alert_msg = f"ð¨ HIGH TEMP ALERT: {city} at {temperature}Â°C"
                logger.warning(alert_msg)
                print(alert_msg)
            elif temperature < self.low_temp_threshold:
                alert_msg = f"âï¸ LOW TEMP ALERT: {city} at {temperature}Â°C"
                logger.warning(alert_msg)
                print(alert_msg)
            
            # Display comprehensive weather information
            weather_info = (
                f"ð {city} | ð¡ï¸ {temperature}Â°C | ð§ {data['humidity']}% | "
                f"ð¬ï¸ {data['wind_speed']} m/s | {data['condition']} | "
                f"ð {data['timestamp']}"
            )
            
            print(weather_info)
            logger.info(f"Processed message #{self.message_count} for {city}")
            
        except KeyError as e:
            logger.error(f"Missing key in message: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error processing message: {e}")
    
    def start_consuming(self):
        """Start consuming messages from Kafka with graceful shutdown"""
        logger.info("Starting weather data consumption...")
        
        try:
            for message in self.consumer:
                self.process_message(message)
                
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            logger.info("Consumer stopped by user")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected error in consumer: {e}")
        finally:
            self.consumer.close()
            logger.info("Consumer closed gracefully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        bootstrap_servers = sys.argv[1]
        consumer = WeatherDataConsumer(bootstrap_servers)
    else:
        consumer = WeatherDataConsumer()
    
    consumer.start_consuming()
```

        }
        self.producer = Producer(self.config)
        self.topic = 'weather-stream'
        
        logger.info("Confluent Cloud producer initialized")
    
    def delivery_callback(self, err, msg):
        """Handle message delivery reports with detailed logging"""
        if err:
            logger.error(f'Message delivery failed: {err}')
        else:
            logger.debug(f'Message delivered to {msg.topic()} [{msg.partition()}] at offset {msg.offset()}')
    
    def produce_weather_data(self, weather_data):
        """Produce weather data to Confluent Cloud with error handling"""
        try:
            self.producer.produce(
                topic=self.topic,
                key=weather_data['city'].encode('utf-8'),
                value=json.dumps(weather_data),
                callback=self.delivery_callback,
                timestamp=int(datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000)
            )
            
            # Poll to handle delivery callbacks
            self.producer.poll(0)
            logger.info(f"Produced weather data for {weather_data['city']}")
            
        except BufferError as e:
            logger.error(f"Local producer queue full: {e}")
            # Handle queue full error
            self.producer.poll(1)
            # Retry or implement backpressure strategy
    
    def flush_messages(self, timeout=30):
        """Wait for all messages to be delivered with timeout"""
        remaining = self.producer.flush(timeout)
        if remaining > 0:
            logger.warning(f"{remaining} messages remain undelivered after flush")
        else:
            logger.info("All messages delivered successfully")

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    producer = ConfluentCloudProducer()
    
    sample_data = {
        "city": "Nairobi",
        "temperature": 25.5,
        "humidity": 65,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    
    producer.produce_weather_data(sample_data)
    producer.flush_messages()
```

## Best Practices for Production Kafka Deployment

### Configuration Optimization

**Producer Configuration Excellence**:
```python
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092', 'kafka3:9092'],
    acks='all',                    # Maximum durability
    retries=10,                    # Adequate retry attempts
    retry_backoff_ms=1000,         # Exponential backoff
    compression_type='snappy',     # Network optimization
    batch_size=16384,              # 16KB batches
    linger_ms=10,                  # Batching window
    buffer_memory=33554432,        # 32MB buffer
    max_in_flight_requests_per_connection=5,  # Throughput optimization
    request_timeout_ms=30000,      # Network timeout
    delivery_timeout_ms=120000     # Total delivery timeout
)
```

**Consumer Configuration Mastery**:
```python
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'weatherstream',
    bootstrap_servers=['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092', 'kafka3:9092'],
    group_id='weather-dashboard',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    enable_auto_commit=False,      # Manual commit for reliability
    session_timeout_ms=10000,
    heartbeat_interval_ms=3000,
    max_poll_interval_ms=300000,
    max_poll_records=500,          # Control processing batch size
    fetch_min_bytes=1,
    fetch_max_wait_ms=500,
    fetch_max_bytes=52428800       # 50MB max fetch size
)
```

### Monitoring and Operational Excellence

**Essential Metrics to Monitor**:
- **Producer Metrics**: Record send rate, error rate, compression ratio
- **Consumer Metrics**: Lag, fetch rate, poll rate, rebalance events
- **Broker Metrics**: Network IO, disk usage, request latency, under-replicated partitions
- **Cluster Health**: Controller status, offline partitions, ISR shrinks

**Alerting Strategy**:
- Immediate alerts for broker downtime or controller unavailability
- Warning alerts for consumer lag exceeding thresholds
- Capacity alerts for disk usage approaching limits
- Performance alerts for latency spikes

## Conclusion: Kafka's Evolving Landscape

Apache Kafka has matured from LinkedIn's internal messaging system to become the cornerstone of modern data infrastructure. Its journey reflects the industry's shift toward real-time data processing and event-driven architectures.

The comprehensive setup processâfrom Zookeeper initialization to producer-consumer implementationâdemonstrates Kafka's robustness and flexibility. Whether deploying on-premises or using managed services like Confluent Cloud, Kafka provides a proven foundation for building scalable, reliable data pipelines.
